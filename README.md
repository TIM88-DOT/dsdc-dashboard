This project was bootstrapped with [Create Eth App](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app) and the
[Uniswap v2](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app/tree/develop/templates/react/uniswap-v2) template.

This template contains 2 packages:

- [contracts](/packages/contracts)
- [react-app](/packages/react-app)

The React app implements a basic example for how to connect and pull data from the
[Uniswap v2](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/uniswap/uniswap-v2) subgraph.
